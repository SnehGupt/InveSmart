# BankSmart 🧠💼

BankSmart is a smart assistant for investment banking analysts. It helps users run Leveraged Buyout (LBO) models, generate memos, SWOT analyses, and pitch decks using Gemini AI.

## 🔧 What’s Inside

- `LBO_Model/` → Spreadsheet files for deal modeling (IRR, MOIC, exit value)
- `Prompts/` → Gemini prompt templates for memos, SWOTs, and pitch decks
- `Outputs/` → AI-generated results based on deal inputs
- `Docs/` → Planning notes, coordinator feedback, and project summaries

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Fill in the LBO spreadsheet with deal assumptions
2. Copy the numbers into Gemini prompts
3. Run the prompts in Google AI Studio
4. Save the outputs in organized folders
5. Share results with your team or mentors

## 🚀 Goals

- Help interns and analysts learn faster
- Automate repetitive investment banking tasks
- Simulate real analyst workflows for training and education
