# Investment Memo: Finly LBO

We recommend proceeding with the LBO of Finly at a 10x entry multiple, supported by $60M in debt and $20M in equity. With projected EBITDA growth and a 12x exit multiple over a 5-year horizon, the deal is expected to deliver an IRR of ~27%, exceeding our target. Key risks include customer churn and pricing pressure, which may impact margin expansion. Overall, the transaction offers attractive upside with manageable downside.
